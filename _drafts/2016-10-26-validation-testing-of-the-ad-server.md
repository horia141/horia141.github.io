This article is a little bit of PR for a library I've just released.

I work on the ads team on Stack Overflow. Ironically, we don't have that much to do with the "traditional" banner-style ads on the page. Rather, we take care of the job recommendations which appear on question pages, the front page etc. We like to think of ourselves as the ads team, so I'll use ads terminology. Here's an example of our handiwork:

While some of the inner workings of Stack Overflow [links] have been documented elsewhere, much hasn't been said about the ads bits. This post will shed a little light _and_ talk about a recent piece of infrastructure we've open-sourced, a small C# library for _validation testing_ [better name].
