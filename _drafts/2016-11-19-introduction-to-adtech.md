This is the first of a many-parts series of articles on Internet advertising technology. Or _AdTech_, for short. This is not an especially well covered topic online, so perhaps this will be useful to people.

[ Who this series is addressed to ]

We all have an intuitive understanding of what [_advertising_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising) is. It is a form of communication where one party tries to convince another party of something. We call the first party the _advertiser_, while the second the _audience_. The object in the vast majority of cases is commercial. The advertiser tries to convince the audience to buy a product or use a service. There is also non-commercial advertising, such as political ads or public services announcements. They're nowhere near as big, though.

_AdTech_ is the technology of advertising **on the Internet**. That last bit is crucial. Advertising has always involved a bit of technology. For example, for the printing of newspaper ads or filming of commercials. Buy, it is only with the rise of the Internet, that the technical component has taken a crucial role.  One that warrants a whole engineering discipline dedicated to it. Indeed, some of the largest tech companies in the world make their money from AdTech.

That's it for this post. Hopefully you've begun to have a better appreciation of the topic. There's still a lot of ground to cover until we reach the _tech_ phase. In the next post we'll go into more details on the various players in the industry.
