I'm a big fan of our industry's openness to people from all backgrounds. As the [StackOverflow developer survey](bla) stats show, fully 50% of all developers don't have a formal CS or technical background. Granted, there's a bias towards web developers on SO, but still. This is in fact the only place where IT shows large diversity. Pun intended.

A common thread, especially in IT universities, people start working.

The gist of my issue is this: nothing good will come out of it and you'll miss out on a lot of things you _can only do in university_.

But how did you come in possession of such sage wisdom, Horia, you might ask? As always with these things, through doing and getting burned. I started working in my 2nd year of university. I then worked, with a break of a couple of months, all through my 4th year. I finally smarted up towards the end of my 4th year, and joined a masters program and was focused 100% on it. I had to learn a lot of the stuff I should had learned in my undergraduate years, atop all the new fancy stuff from the master. But it was a really good experience, and the knowledge I gathered there continues to pay dividends. On the other hand, one of the jobs I had during that time, I don't even mention on my CV. The other is usually not counted by employers as "experience", since many don't grok the Romanian concept of working in university. The experiences themselves weren't that great. One of the places didn't use source control, for example.

As with all advice, this one isn't universal. Sometimes, you _have_ to work. It's hard to focus on studying when there's no food on the table. Othertimes, you're just _that_ good and you have Google and Facebook fighting over you. No point in wasting time on this blog. However, for the _rest_ of you, this might be useful.

Why you might quit:

- Not learning the right stuff in school. All theory, less practice.
- The diploma isn't good. Especially with plagiarism concerns.
- Work experience is gonna be good.

Why you should stay:

- Last time to learn loads of theory. After this, it's gonna be hard to read big heavy books in a concentrated manner. You're gonna have to stay up to date with tech, and learn more practical stuff.
- A diploma is a diploma. There are still certain advantages - the 16% reduction, can start a PFA, can hold leadership positions in companies / the state. There's a whole matter of law around this.
- 1-2 extra years of experience in a 50 year career isn't worth jack.
- You'll most likely be at the bottom of the totem pole. Who's gonna be above you? Fresh grads, people with experience, everybody else. Projects aren't going to be cool, you aren't going to learn as much.
- Student life is good. It's, for most people, a good combination of a lot of rights and no obligations. Don't be in a hurry to leave it.

Alternatives:
- Work part time. Not that great. Things have a way of going to full time.
- Work over the summer. Do an intenrship for companies who have this.
- Freelance on small side-projects.
