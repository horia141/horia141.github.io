I'm a big fan of our industry's openness to people from all backgrounds. As the [StackOverflow developer survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-education) highlights, some 40% of all developers don't have a formal CS or even technical background. There is a bias towards web development in that survey, but, even in the larger population of developers, this is likely to be the case.

Given this, and the relatively high salaries one can get as an entry level developer, in Romania, it's unsurprising many people in technical universities start working sometime in their 2nd or 3rd years.

However, as I hope to make clear in this article, nothing good can come out of such an arrangement.

But how did you come in possession of such sage wisdom, Horia, you might ask? As always with these things, through doing and getting burned. I started working in my 2nd year of university. I continued through to my 4th year. I finally smarted up towards the end of my 4th year, and joined a masters program and was focused 100% on it. I had to learn a lot of the stuff I should had learned in my undergraduate years, atop all the new fancy stuff from the master. But it was a really good experience, and the knowledge I gathered there continues to pay dividends. On the other hand, one of the jobs I had during that time, I don't even mention on my CV. The other is usually not counted by employers as "work experience". The experiences themselves weren't that great. One of the places didn't use source control, for example.

As with all advice, this one isn't universal. Sometimes, you _have_ to work. It's hard to focus on studying when there's no food on the table. Othertimes, you're just _that_ good and you have Google and Facebook fighting over you. No point in wasting time on this blog. However, for the _rest_ of you, this might be useful.

Why you might quit:

- Not learning the right stuff in school. All theory, less practice. This is a perenial complaint about higher education in Romania. While there's a grain/blob of truth to it, this misses the point of university. If you don't like the courses you have, you can easily stufy your own version. It's more about the free time. It's not that hard to get a passing 5 in university subjects.
- The diploma isn't good. Especially with plagiarism concerns.
- Work experience is gonna be good.

Why you should stay:

- Last time to learn loads of theory. After this, it's gonna be hard to read big heavy books in a concentrated manner. You're gonna have to stay up to date with tech, and learn more practical stuff.
- A diploma is a diploma. There are still certain advantages - the 16% reduction, can start a PFA, can hold leadership positions in companies / the state. There's a whole matter of law around this.
- 1-2 extra years of experience in a 50 year career isn't worth jack. Companies aren't going to take it into consideration anyways, more or less.
- Most of the cool exciting stuff in CS today: Machine Learning / Deep Learning / AI, Bitcoin, distributed systems, VR etc. require a lot of math, CS, statistics etc. to understand. You won't be contributing to these things with what you learn in undergrad, but at least you'll know enough to understand and use them. That's an easy differentiator later in the career.
- You'll most likely be at the bottom of the totem pole. Who's gonna be above you? Fresh grads, people with experience, everybody else. Projects aren't going to be cool, you aren't going to learn as much.
- Student life is good. It's, for most people, a good combination of a lot of rights and no obligations. Don't be in a hurry to leave it.
- The competition is doing it. Your peers from other universities are doing it. They're gonna come in the workforce knowing a lot more than you.
- It's free. Few countries in the world where this is the case. Even in the cases where it's not the ROI is still there.

Alternatives:
- Work part time. Not that great. Things have a way of going to full time.
- Work over the summer. Do an intenrship for companies who have this.
- Freelance on small side-projects.
