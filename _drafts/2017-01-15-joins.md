Joins are a perenial source of confusion among web programmers, especially those who don't interact that much directly with the database. However, they're an indispensible and powerful tool for interacting with the database.

However, in a standard setting, joins are used to do something pretty simple, which can best be described as "fetch other data related to the data I already have". I believe this is the most common use case as well, and it's a pity it's not put more often in the forefront.



One of the reasons joins are harder to grok than selects and wheres is that programmers don't have a prebuilt mental model for them. It's I think safe to assume that most people first learn one or more programming languages before coming to SQL and having to interact with the database. Hence, they have a good mental model of how "programming languages" work. So filtering a dataset or transforming one dataset to another is quite well ingrained in them as a means to solve problems. If they've had exposure to functional programming, this will be doubly so. However, most programming languages don't have `join` as a standard library function, like they have `map` or `filter`. Hence, the tool is unused. Granted, it doesn't make that much sense to have it when all the data is in main memory and easily linkable via pointers. When moving to SQL, join is this wierd construct begat by the way data is represented. It's one big source of the alieness of SQL.
