Quite recently, the Romanian Academy has released a sort of plan for the country. It's an ambitious project of things to fix in the country. One thing in particular stood out - their plan for fixing the brain drain. In short, they'd want people who leave the country straight after finishing their studies to pay back what the Romanian state has spent educating them.

This has caused some controversy online. People were not happy.

Now, the Romanian Academy is not without it's faults [many links here]. It's defining characteristic is the Romanian part, rather than the Academy part. Contrast this with the US Academy of Science or the Royal Academy [ not RA, find equivalent in UK] etc., homologous institutions but which people respect much more highly.

However even a broken clock is right once a day. I _do_ think there's something to what they're proposing, and against the spirit of the Internet, I think it's worthwhile to explore the idea.

First, some disclaimers. I am definitely a person who profited of this system. I got my schooling for free at the UPB. And shortly after I gratuated, I moved to London for 3 years. I'm back now, though. So I was a drained brain, for a while, so to say.
Ironically, it was my talking with colleagues there that swayed my thinking on this. Our system is definitely not universal.

First off, there is a _brain drain_ problem. No arguing about it. It can only be fully solved by rasing the standards of living and quality of life in Romania to reach western Europe standards. No two ways about that. There's still going to be migration, but at that point it would be a natural effect rather than a forced one. [ more details here ]

Would this thing solve it? Let's look at what other countries are doing, and get some data involved.

First of all, Romania is in really good company wrt providing free higher education to it's citizens. Only the Nordics offer something equivalent. There are similar programs in the US for returing soldiers - the G.I Bill, but nothing universal. That shouldn't make us feel _very good_ though. There's a world of difference between those countries and our own. More specifically, one can't speak of a brain drain from Sweeden. The place is already nice - there's no reason to leave _just to get away_. There might be others though, but manageable at the level of a country.
All the other countries in the world (we care about) have education which is paied for. Even for public institutions. The sums aren't great, but there are.

Investigate countries with free education & extra constraints:
- Hard to get out
- Have to stay

So we're in a unique position of offering free education and people wanting to leave [rephrase it] and being easy to leave. The brain drain is inevitable. At the level of the individual this is great. A capable high-school graduate can train as an IT engineer, medical doctor, economist, etc. for free, and then they can go to another country. Their peers in that other country gratuate endebted for several years - and possibly for live (looking at you US). 

So, given that, I think it's not a far fetch to say that education in Romania is quite the privilege, compared to other countries. Does it not make _some_ sense to add some strings to it?

Priority number one should absolutely be to alleviate the need for leaving. It's slowly starting to happen. And definitely the whole story about Ord 13 prooves that the place is at it's best since 1989. Definitely not enough, but still a good sign.

However, being free, people will squander it. Several authors complain about how universities don't prepare canidates for _real life_, and there's a lot of ills to the romanian system. But when the choice is literally cost free at the moment it's hard. If university cost something, people would think more about it. Does it make sense to pay 10k over 3 years for a Comms degree? Perhaps not? Right now, a person finds out near the end of their university degree, when they try to get a job. The prospect of having to pay some money might make people make a more informed decision [1]. 

As a side note, the system is _partially free_. Only your first go at higher education is free. If you want to follow a second university, you have to pay up. Ditto, there's a certain number of free places. But theres a minitority which is payed.

[1] The decision has to be informed. In the US/UK people make the same mistakes, due to the availability of loans.
