Quite recently, the Romanian Academy has released a sort of plan for the country. It's an ambitious project of things to fix in the country. One thing in particular stood out - their plan for fixing the brain drain. In short, they'd want people who leave the country straight after finishing their studies to pay back what the Romanian state has spent educating them.

This has caused some controversy online. People were not happy.

Now, the Romanian Academy is not without it's faults [many links here]. It's defining characteristic is the Romanian part, rather than the Academy part. Contrast this with the US Academy of Science or the Royal Academy [ not RA, find equivalent in UK] etc., homologous institutions but which people respect much more highly.

However even a broken clock is right once a day. I _do_ think there's something to what they're proposing, and against the spirit of the Internet, I think it's worthwhile to explore the idea.

First, some disclaimers. I am definitely a person who profited of this system. I got my schooling for free at the UPB. And shortly after I gratuated, I moved to London for 3 years. I'm back now, though. So I was a drained brain, for a while, so to say.
Ironically, it was my talking with colleagues there that swayed my thinking on this. Our system is definitely not universal.

First off, there is a _brain drain_ problem. No arguing about it. It can only be fully solved by rasing the standards of living and quality of life in Romania to reach western Europe standards. No two ways about that. There's still going to be migration, but at that point it would be a natural effect rather than a forced one. [ more details here ]

Would this thing solve it? Let's look at what other countries are doing, and get some data involved.

First of all, Romania is in really good company wrt providing free higher education to it's citizens. Only the Nordics offer something equivalent. There are similar programs in the US for returing soldiers - the G.I Bill, but nothing universal.

Arguably, the nordics don't have a brain drain. Even so
