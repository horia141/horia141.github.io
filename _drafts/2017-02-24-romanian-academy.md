The gist: there's some truth to what the academy is saying. There _is_ a problem, and we should be thinking of a solution to it. The way people are positioned towards higher education might need to be adjusted. States and societies don't provide healthcare and education without looking at the benefits they stand to gain from them, in general. It's a case of actions which try to maximize the social good. However, with this setup, it's not the case that it is.

The Romanian Academy [todo:link] has recently released the volume ["Romania's Development Strategy For The Next 20 Years - Volume III - Part 2"](http://www.acad.ro/bdar/strategiaAR/doc13/StrategiaIII_2.pdf). At almost 1000 pages it is quite the long and detailed read, and covers topics from education to finance and monetary policy. A thing stood out however. One of the proposals for education was requiring students who went to a public university [todo:better phrasing] to work in the country for a period of time equal to that in which they were students.

People picked up on this and were quite mad. [Todo: better phrasing][Todo: links to LM and Republica].

I'm writing this article with a contrarian spirit, and want to offer a counterpoint to the online consensus that this is a terrible idea.

First of, we shouldn't panic, nobody's forcing students to do anything anytime soon. The Romanian Academy doesn't have any power to set policy. It might have the ear of policymakers, but those need to filter their suggestions through the lens of public opinion. This thing is likely to spark protests from _all_ students, and lead to the rolling of the head of the education minister who'd propose it.

Second, the proposal as is would butt heads with a lot of European and worldwide human rights legislation. If the issue wouldn't be solved internally, external pressure might work.

However, even a broken clock is right once a day. The folks at the Academy have righly identified the "brain drain" as a big issue facing the country. Their solution is quite blunt and there's a definite aroma of old-school communist authoritarianism to it, but it has _some_ kernel of usability to it.

First, some background. I did a little bit of research. Turns out most countries in the European Union offer free or almost-free education to students, both citizens, EU nationals and international students. The only big countries where this doesn't happen is the UK and Poland. The situation is much the same globally, with the US, Canada, Australia etc standing out as countries with non-free tertiary education. In any case, most 

First, some disclaimers. I am definitely a person who profited of this system. I got my schooling for free at the UPB. And shortly after I gratuated, I moved to London for 3 years. I'm back now, though. So I was a drained brain, for a while, so to say.
Ironically, it was my talking with colleagues there that swayed my thinking on this. Our system is definitely not universal.

First off, there is a _brain drain_ problem. No arguing about it. It can only be fully solved by rasing the standards of living and quality of life in Romania to reach western Europe standards. No two ways about that. There's still going to be migration, but at that point it would be a natural effect rather than a forced one. [ more details here ]

Would this thing solve it? Let's look at what other countries are doing, and get some data involved.

First of all, Romania is in really good company wrt providing free higher education to it's citizens. Only the Nordics offer something equivalent. There are similar programs in the US for returing soldiers - the G.I Bill, but nothing universal. That shouldn't make us feel _very good_ though. There's a world of difference between those countries and our own. More specifically, one can't speak of a brain drain from Sweeden. The place is already nice - there's no reason to leave _just to get away_. There might be others though, but manageable at the level of a country.
All the other countries in the world (we care about) have education which is paied for. Even for public institutions. The sums aren't great, but there are.

Investigate countries with free education & extra constraints:
- Hard to get out
- Have to stay

So we're in a unique position of offering free education and people wanting to leave [rephrase it] and being easy to leave. The brain drain is inevitable. At the level of the individual this is great. A capable high-school graduate can train as an IT engineer, medical doctor, economist, etc. for free, and then they can go to another country. Their peers in that other country gratuate endebted for several years - and possibly for live (looking at you US). 

So, given that, I think it's not a far fetch to say that education in Romania is quite the privilege, compared to other countries. Does it not make _some_ sense to add some strings to it?

Priority number one should absolutely be to alleviate the need for leaving. It's slowly starting to happen. And definitely the whole story about Ord 13 prooves that the place is at it's best since 1989. Definitely not enough, but still a good sign.

However, being free, people will squander it. Several authors complain about how universities don't prepare canidates for _real life_, and there's a lot of ills to the romanian system. But when the choice is literally cost free at the moment it's hard. If university cost something, people would think more about it. Does it make sense to pay 10k over 3 years for a Comms degree? Perhaps not? Right now, a person finds out near the end of their university degree, when they try to get a job. The prospect of having to pay some money might make people make a more informed decision [1]. 

As a side note, the system is _partially free_. Only your first go at higher education is free. If you want to follow a second university, you have to pay up. Ditto, there's a certain number of free places. But theres a minitority which is payed.

Let's get one thing straight out of the way. Education is Romania is free in principle, but not in practice. Depending on one's inclinations there are costs like "fondul clasei", buying extra books from the school and the teachers get kickbacks, meditations, after-schools etc. And this is before one goes to university. Becoming a lawyer or nottary is quite difficult without a lot of $$$.

[1] The decision has to be informed. In the US/UK people make the same mistakes, due to the availability of easy loans as well as the still pervasive belief that a university education will set one up for life, regardless of field or individual qualities.
