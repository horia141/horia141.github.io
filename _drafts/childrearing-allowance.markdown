Now, for a change of pace.

If you've been following the local news, you've no doubt stumbled upon this little gem. The gist of it is this: the goverment enacted a fairly progressive pro-family scheme. Then it did some number crunching, and it turns out there's like massive inequality.

This thing has been commented in every other place. Comment sections, facebook etc. Even twitter, for the 10 romanians who use it.

It's a boneheaded response.

First of all. The response itself. The goverment should be a little more supportive of it's own programs.

Then, the fact that they did the number crunching post fact. This is data they have. Whether it's accessible or not to somebody making a law, is another matter, but they should have looked at how the spread of money would look like post law.

Finally, I think their approach is boneheaded. Their response to "there's too much inequality in the system", is to cap it at the extreme end. So they're gonna chop a 35k a month salary to a 10k or whatever they feel seems reasonable. But why not go the other route? Why not increase the allowance for all the other folks who make less. That's another way of combating the inequality. Instead of having a max, have a min. God knows there's money. Or at least, His representative here in Romania, The too-happy Daniel, since his organization was recently the beneficiary of a 4m EUR gift from city hall.

Also, one final point. The maximum salary for somebody is 35k a month. Presumably, there's somebody making more than that.
