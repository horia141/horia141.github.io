[ Story about getting a name ]

How to properly deal with last names in todays world. But what would happen to children? Some solutions.

Select at random.
Make it a concatenation.
Make it a string merge.

What's the point of last names anyhow? Why not drop them. We'd have just names. We could have several, but they'd all be equal. No need to name children in a certain way. Perhaps Jr. Or III, but nothing more. We have national ID databases to uniquely identify people (well x/y countries, others have to rely on SSNs). And we have DNA tests to establish paternity/maternity. Would perhaps increase number of names. There are only w most common names. Talk about the distribution of names.
