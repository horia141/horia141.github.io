Quick question - have you ever used an xUnit library? You probably have? Which one though? JUnit (link)? CUnit (link)? unittest? RubyUnit etc?

We've recently seen the rise of libraries which span multiple languages. Polyglot libraries and 

Angular is a good example of a polyglot framework. It has a javascript, typescript and dart variant. Polymer as well.
Mockito is another library which seems to be universal. WebDriver.
React, ReactNative. Guice-like dependency injection.

It's gonna be harder for new libaries to compete at some point. And what works in one language is not necessariy what will work in another. Or perhaps more insisdious, two languages might be superficially the same, hence you tend to write the two libraries in a similar fashion, but not being Pythonic etc.

But in the end, if the reason to choose a language is also it's ecosystem, if all languages have the same ecosystem, the choice becomes moot.

On the flipside, what's needed for a language to be considered usable? No longer a compiler and a decent standard library. Currelt, that would be: compiler&dev kit, package manager & globally available repository, IDE interaction, large standard library and presence of some well known libraries for web development (or whatever nieche you're in really).

On the other hand, it becomes easier to sell switching to a new language if there's already all the needed tooling for it.
