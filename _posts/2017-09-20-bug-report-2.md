This is the second in a series of articles about bugs I encounter while working. The [first one](http://horia141.com/bug-report-1.html) was about `GETUTCDATE()` and how it complicates things in longer queries.

Today's bug is about [LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/getting-started-with-linq) and the lazy `IEnumerables` it produces. A one-off script on which I spent way too much time worked something like this:

{% highlight csharp %}
IEnumerable<Item> items = RawItems().Select(i => i.Transform());
foreach (var item in items)
    item.name = $"{item.name} #Modified";
UpdateItems(items);
{% endhighlight %}
  
Granted, not the most elegant code. But I thought it was enough to do it's job. Turns out there's a simple yet subtle bug occurring. Turns out that `Select` is quite lazy, so `items` is more like a promise that if you're iterating it you'll get the result of `Transform()` applied to each element from `RawItems`. But every time the iterator is used, that computation gets redone.

So the `foreach` loop actually modified each resulting element from one invocation of the iterator, but all that data was thrown away. When `UpdateItems` used `items` it obtained a new version of the derived data, without any of the modifications.

The solution is simple. Either include the modification as part of the `Select` and alongside `Transform`. Or make `items` non-lazy, by turning it into an `List` or `Array`, which is what I ended up doing for simplicity's sake in my actual setup. So the code was now just:

{% highlight csharp %}
IEnumerable<Item> items = RawItems().Select(i => i.Transform()).ToList();
foreach (var item in items)
    item.name = $"{item.name} #Modified";
UpdateItems(items);
{% endhighlight %}
  
Since the `foreach` loop and `UpdateItems` now referenced a list, instead of the iterator over something, the desired behaviour was achieved.
