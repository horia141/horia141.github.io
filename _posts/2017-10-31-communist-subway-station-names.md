Bucharest, the city where I was born, grew up and currently reside, has a medium scale [subway system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest_Metro). One of the stranger things people complain about is the _bad_ station names. Perennial favorites are “Precision”, ["The Flatting Mill"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9n1LAOCHuso), "Peace", "Heroes", "The Polytechnic", "Writers", "Horizon", "Modern Times", "Defenders Of The Country", "Aviators", "The Youth", etc.

However, it’s hard for somebody who isn’t from Romania or from a former [eastern bloc country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc) to grasp just what’s wrong with them. The _badness_ stems from the fact that they’re “communist sounding”. Which basically means that they’re abstract-ish nouns or verbs, usually related to industry, science or the parts of the past the party deemed "glorious". Most of the times they are written in a very specific way as well, as if they were part of a larger congratulatory sentence. So the proper English translation would be “Precision" not as in “The _precision_ of this device is 2 nanometers", but rather "Dedicated to the _precision_". Or "Dedicated to the _heroes/aviators/the youth/writers/etc_".

Now, most stations are named after the surrounding area they’re serving, so the criticism should be addressed at the city for having bad names. However, since it’s very hard to change city area or street names, and relatively easy to change subway station names, I think it’s fair to complain about the latter. And it's [been done before](http://economie.hotnews.ro/stiri-consumator-5899953-opt-statii-metrou-incepand-sambata-nume-noi.htm) to some success. Before 2009, we also had "The Combine Harvester", "The Army Of The People" and "Industries". But while the latter two got decent new names, such as ["Petrache Poenaru"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrache_Poenaru) (the inventor of the [Fountain Pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_pen)), and "Lujerului" (a proper name of an area), respectively, "Industries" became "Precision". To add insult to injury, "Laromet" (again a proper name of a company), became "The Flatting Mill". Come to think of it, perhaps that's not the _most efficient_ way.

Anyway, there's no point to this post. Just a thing I wanted to write. So there you have it.
