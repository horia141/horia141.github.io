And now it's time for a small rant.

The other day I heard a colleague say that they solved a problem _with some help from Google_. By which he meant that they used Google's search to find an answer to their problem. And herein lies my problem. It wasn't Google which provided the answer. That was usually on some blog post or GitHub issue or StackOverflow answer. All written by another human. Google simply found the answer. It had _some_ merit, definitely not all of it and perhaps even a minority of it.

And that's the way it goes. Both with Google and StackOverflow, because they are the common denominator in all tech searches, and because they're so ubiquitous, they end up being the only thing mentioned.

There really isn't a solution unfortunately.
