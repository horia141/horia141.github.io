I've compiled a bunch of links of the multi-repo vs mono-repo choice. It's been a hot topic of debate at work.

[Advantages of monorepos (2015)](https://danluu.com/monorepo/) - Dan Luu on why a bunch of large companies use monorepos and a bit on the tooling for them.

[Repo style wars - monorepo vs multirepo (2017)](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/mono-vs-multi/) - covers a bit of the pros and cons of each method. Also has a list of monorepo tools.

[Monorepos in git (2015)](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/10/monorepos-in-git/) - a piece from Atlassian. Decidedly against the idea, mostly because the tool won't scale. Though in 3 years, things could have changed in git-land.

[Monorepos in the wild (2017)](https://medium.com/@maoberlehner/monorepos-in-the-wild-33c6eb246cb9) - again pros and cons, examples of Google and Facebook and a bunch of tooling. A good read.
