In the [second part](https://horia141.com/retrofeed-2.html) of this series we looked at the most basic things we could do - package setup, some basic scripts, common integrations etc. And we left it for this third article to cover actually setting up a real application which could do some minimal things, and for the next one to cover infrastructure and making the project public. It turns out there's a bunch to cover here as well, and one article won't do it justice. So I'll only cover the initial application behaviours, a bit of testing and more integrations here, and we'll delay things like sessions and authentication for the next part.

Current file structure

Using NestJs and the first few codes.

Migrations and the plan for them.

Tests for it and what we use.

E2E tests and what we use. Link to run.

Ngrok.

Moving on.
