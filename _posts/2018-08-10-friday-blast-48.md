[Programming in the adult entertainment industry is broken (2018)](https://dev.to/jwoertink/programming-in-the-adult-entertainment-industry-is-broken-hgn) - fun read about all the broken stuff in the _adult entertainment industry_. The root of the issue is that _payments are hard_ when there is a very high percentage of refunds.

[How to upper-bound the probability of something bad (2018)](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3712) - this is mostly useful for people who need to write proofs as part of their day to day work. Still, it's a good refresher for some _normal techniques_ (Markov's Inequality, Chebyshev's Inequality etc), which one might find in non-advanced texts. I also find it a good peek into the mind of somebody doing high-level research. And even they have to look stuff up on Wikipedia :)

[Enhancing the quality of Uber's maps with metrics computation (2018)](https://eng.uber.com/maps-metrics-computation/) - this is something quite relevant to the sort of stuff we do at Taxify (btw, [we're hiring](https://taxify.eu/careers/)), and for many issues Uber [already did it](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-simpsons-did-it). The base idea is how to ensure that the geographic data used is actually _high quality_ and corresponds to _reality_. A lot of nifty data processing is used for this.

[An introduction to hashing in the era of machine learning (2018)](https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/an-introduction-to-hashing-in-the-era-of-machine-learning-6039394549b0) - some time ago a nice paper from Google and MIT circulated where they "learned" an index structure for database access, which was competitive with B-Trees and their variants. This was somehow expected (apply ML to everything!), but from another POV it came out of the blue. That's CS101 stuff right there - the stuff which is supposed to be airtight - well understood problems, good algorithms, theorems etc. None of that pesky _perception_ or _reasoning_ stuff. And here ML was _competing with it_. Big news and a lot of people got excited. The present article deals with how _hashing_ would be affected, given that it's also the same sort of _lookup problem_ ML was good at attacking. The bottom line was that learning to hash is good, but Cuckoo hashing is better. Still, super nice read.

[Becoming a dramatically better programmer (2017)](https://recurse.henrystanley.com/post/better/) - sage advice and some directly applicable skills. In my view, the biggest thing is a mindset of _trying to become better_ and holding yourself accountable to that, rather than coasting along. After that, each person will have their own way of doing things. Biggest thing here is how good _deep work_ really is. I _need_ to get to _Deep Work - The Book_ at some point as well.
