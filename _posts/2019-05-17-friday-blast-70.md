[Deeply understanding JavaScript async and await (2019)](https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-javascript-async-and-await-with-examples-a010b03926ea) - history of callbacks --> promises --> async/await in JavaScript. It's funny that the code he highlights as _callback hell_ I don't find that hard to grok - been doing it at work for some time and I consider it just _decent_, not _hellish_. But yeah, async/await can't come soon enough to all PLs and codebases.

[GitLab's journey from Azure to GCP (2019)](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/05/02/gitlab-journey-from-azure-to-gcp/) - color me surprised, but I didn't know GitLab was on Azure - or any _startup-type_ company for that matter. But here they were and having operational problems to boot. So they switched over to GCP in what appears to be a massive migration - several months and 0.5PBs of data. There wasn't much more meat to pick off this thing - no hiccups, no details of their new setup etc.

[Implementing domain driven design at small improvements (2019)](https://tech.small-improvements.com/implementing-domain-driven-design-at-small-improvements/) - I've used Small Improvements for 1:1 meeting handling and this was quite a nice overview of their code architecture - you can really feel for the _old_ version of the design and how the DDD improvements helped.

[Can we all please stop using Medium now? (2019)](https://www.webdistortion.com/2019/05/16/can-we-all-please-stop-using-medium-now/) - mostly a rant against Medium.

[Microsoft, Slack, Zoom, and the SaaS opportunity (2019)](https://stratechery.com/2019/microsoft-slack-zoom-and-the-saas-opportunity/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds) - excellent stuff from Stratechery - as always really. It looks at how SaaS has worked for three different companies. First, Microsoft which had to migrate away from the "boxed software" model to SaaS - to trillion dollar success. Then Slack which was a pioneer of enterprise SaaS, and aims to be an integrator of various communication systems in a company as much as a chat system. And then Zoom which did one (hard) thing and did it well. I used Zoom and appreciated the fact that it worked well, but wasn't aware it was such a big business - kudos to them.
