[Grace Hopper - nanoseconds #video (2012)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsKnWZrJ8) - Grace Hopper talking about communication latency. Life goals to have such nice presentation skills.

[Seven surprising bash variables (2019)](https://zwischenzugs.com/2019/05/11/seven-surprising-bash-variables/) - what the title says. So much cruft in Bash though.

[Friday deploy freezes are exactly like murdering puppies (2019)](https://charity.wtf/2019/05/01/friday-deploy-freezes-are-exactly-like-murdering-puppies/) - well, not exactly, but still it shows that release processes in your company are too risky. You should be able to launch _whenever_ without risk.

[Hull - an alternative to shell that I'll never have time to implement (2019)](http://250bpm.com/blog:153) - I really dig this latest fashion of airing languages you'd like to exist (but not actually implementing it). This time, a bizzaro shell which stores execution state on disk.

[On the nature of programming languages (2019)](http://250bpm.com/blog:152) - musings on why people design programming languages. Just before the Hull post.
