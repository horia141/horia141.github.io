[The Soviet license plate game and Kolmogorov complexity (2019)](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/02/02/landau-kolmogorov/) - a fistful of awesome! Won't spoil it, but it's also a good example of the difference between something being possible and something being _possible and efficient_.

[Executing a sunset (2019)](https://codeascraft.com/2019/02/01/executing-a-sunset/) - about Etsy's processes around removing products and their data and code. A rarely talked about subject, in this article you'll get a feel for how Etsy sunsat their Wholesale, Studio and Manufacturing products.

[Apple car dreams (2019)](https://mondaynote.com/apple-car-dreams-b25b82997299) - or why Apple isn't making a car anytime soon. There's a bunch of good reasons articulated - for it being very different from their core business (in terms of object being produced, size, price etc), having low margins, self-driving being too far away etc. OTOH, the one thing which isn't addressed is that this would be very in-line with the sort of products Apple is known for - status symbols more than anything.

[Presenting to executives (2018)](https://lethain.com//presenting-to-executives/) - a nice one from Irrational Exhuberance. Definitely counter-intuitive advice than regular _presentation_ ones.

[High availability and scalable reads in PostgreSQL (2018)](https://blog.timescale.com/scalable-postgresql-high-availability-read-scalability-streaming-replication-fb95023e2af/) - details of the streaming replication mechanism in PostgreSQL and how it impacts reads.
