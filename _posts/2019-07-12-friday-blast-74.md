[On being a pricipal engineer (2019)](https://blog.dbsmasher.com/2019/01/28/on-being-a-principal-engineer.html) - many tech companies have a "Pricipal" role on the individual contributor career ladder, and it's usually pretty high there. The author describes what it means to operate at that level in their company, but I think it translates well across the board.

[Logs vs structured events (2019)](https://charity.wtf/2019/02/05/logs-vs-structured-events/) - I've been at places where we were very stingy with what we logged, and at places where we log _everything_. Definitely prefer the latter - which the author calls structured events. Modern storage systems do a well enough job of handling unstructured logs, so there's no reason not to use them to their fullest!

[Don't follow the sun (2019)](https://lethain.com//dont-follow-the-sun/) - advice on setting up on-calls. More precisely Will (whose new book I'm reading and will review shortly) proposes that on-call be a 24/7 affair for folks who are on it, rather than a 9-5 thing split between geographically distributed team, because it first turns it into a thing which "must be under control" rather than a continuous fire and second, it reduces handoff errors (which is why, for better or worse is why you see insane shifts in medicine).

[Get your work recognized - write a brag document (2019)](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) - I've been doing this for a while, but I liked the title, and there's a bunch of extra stuff in there to make it _better_.
