[Meet Michelangelo: Uber's machine learning platform (2019)](https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/) - an overview of Uber's work in "ML platforms". I've seen these sort of systems for "industrial grade" model building and modelling pop-up more and more recently, and Uber's take is quite interesting and comprehensive.

[Why are there no empires in Age of Empires (2019)](https://acoup.blog/2019/11/22/collections-why-are-there-no-empires-in-age-of-empires/) - a nifty blog I stumbled upon recently which looks at pop culture representations of history and how accurate or non-accurate they are.

[File systems unfit as distributed storage backends (2019)](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2019/11/sosp19-file-systems-unfit-as.html) - an overview of a recent paper from the Ceph team, and how they finally decided to go all-in on amanging disks for the Ceph object store, rather than rely on the file system and it's bad fit to the issues posed by such systems.

[Using spatial data with Amazon Redshift (2019)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/using-spatial-data-with-amazon-redshift/) - AWS recently added spatial datatype support to Redshift, and this is a tutorial for performing some interesting aggregations with them.
