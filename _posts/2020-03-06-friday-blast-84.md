[A successful Git branching model (2010)](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) - the introduction of git-flow, a popular branching model for git.

[MezzFS - mounting object storage in Netflix's media processing platform (2019)](https://netflixtechblog.com/mezzfs-mounting-object-storage-in-netflixs-media-processing-platform-cda01c446ba) - another one on Netflix' media processing systems. This time around making media files (essentially big blobs of data where you need streaming _and_ random access) available as file system entities in order to simplify processing for them.

[What is the ultimate fate of the loneliest galaxy in the universe (2019)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/12/18/what-is-the-ultimate-fate-of-the-loneliest-galaxy-in-the-universe/#6e4cc13f566a) - again an astronomy post about the fate of the Universe in general, and that of it's most lonely galaxy. Interesting stuff especially around the timescales involved - trillions of years!

[Designing a package manager from the ground up - an inside look at CircleCI orbs (2019)](https://circleci.com/blog/designing-a-package-manager-from-the-ground-up/) - I recently played around with GitHub Actions, but was keen on how CircleCI solves the CI package management problem.

[Netflix is not a tech company (2019)](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/7/31/Netflix) - it's a content company. Again, an article about Netflix. But I think it holds true for a lot of the later companies coming in - Uber/Lyft/Bolt/etc are essentially transportation companies with beefed up tech, TransferWise/Monzo/Revolut/etc are essentially banks or financial institutions with beefed up tech, AirBnB is essentially a hotel chain with beefed up tech, etc. In the future, _all_ companies will need the beefed up tech, but it's perhaps more evident in the marketplace space.

[Domain-driven design needen't be hard (2020)](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/domain-driven-design-neednt-be-hard-heres-how-start) - a laymans overview of DDD. Good for me, cause I'm not well versed in DDD.
