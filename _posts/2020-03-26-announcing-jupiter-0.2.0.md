Today marks the date of the second "minor" release of Jupiter - version `0.2.0`.

The biggest public facing change is the addition of [public docs](https://jupiter-goals.readthedocs.io). They're hosted on [read-the-docs.io](https://readthedocs.org/), and the docs are generated from the repo itself via a nice integration. How things have changed!

The second change is adding a [difficulty](https://jupiter-goals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/#tasks) rating to jobs, and a bit better sorting of inbox views in Notion.

The third change is adding support for linting. It's a tech only change, but it's a nice step towards "better code quality".
