[Technology holy wars are coordination problems (2020)](https://www.gwern.net/Holy-wars) - a point about how and when
holy-wars in technology appear. Basically when there's multiple competing ecosystems, and choosing one will mean the

[Decomposing functions of many variables to functions of one variable (2020)](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/07/15/kolmogorov-superposition/) -
Apparently there's a way to transform multi-variable functions into operations on single-value functions. Seems quite
uncomputable, but it's an interesting property to have.

[Introducing Yelp's ML platform (2020)](https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2020/07/ML-platform-overview.html) - the ML

[How we migrated application servers from Unicorn to Puma (2020)](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/07/08/migrating-to-puma-on-gitlab/) - 
Unicorn and Puma are application servers for Ruby. Unicorn is a classical multi-process system, whereas Puma is a

worked and what didn't.
