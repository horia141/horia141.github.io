[When you should NOT use Rails (2020)](http://codefol.io/posts/when-should-you-not-use-rails/) - I've never used
Ruby on Rails, but it does seem like a great tool - opinionated, powerful, flexible, etc. However, like all tools it
has its place and might not be good in "all circumstances". Folks sometimes forget this. The linked article talks a
couple of such situations, and what alternatives there are.

[Introducing Domain-Oriented microservices architecture (2020)](https://eng.uber.com/microservice-architecture/) - 
regardless of your opinion of Uber as a business, or of their seemingly excessive tech, you have to give credit that
many of their ideas are good and intriguing. This one is like that - transposing 
[Domain Driven Design](https://dddcommunity.org/learning-ddd/what_is_ddd/) ideas to the realm of microservices. But
not just inside "one microservice", but in _groups of them_, corresponding to business domains.

[What you should know before you start grad school in English Literature (2012)](https://jakeseliger.com/2012/05/22/what-you-should-know-before-you-start-grad-school-in-english-literature-the-economic-financial-and-opportunity-costs/) -
Tl;dr: don't do it!

[Can engineering productivity be measured (2020)](https://charity.wtf/2020/07/07/questionable-advice-can-engineering-productivity-be-measured/) - 
to a certain degree yes. But only if you're looking at teams, and if you have proper processes in place - from
outcome based goals, to performance calibrations, etc.

[Common hiring manager mistakes (2020)](https://lethain.com/common-hiring-manager-mistakes/) - designing a proper
engineering interview s ystem is a _hard thing_. Besides building it, you need to make sure you're not screwing up in
a bunch of "little" ways - lack of calibration, lack of predefined steps, not getting the data you want, etc.
