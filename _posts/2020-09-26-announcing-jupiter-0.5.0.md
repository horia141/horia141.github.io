As promised, the `0.5.0` release comes much faster than the `0.4.2` one. It includes a single change, namely
[smart list](https://jupiter-goals.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts/smart-lists/). It's a significant addition
however, and the first foray outside task-planning for Jupiter.

Smart lists essentially are lists. You can use them to build lists of books to read, movies you've watched, etc.
Long term, there's gonna be some actual smartness added to them - syncing with YouTube, or Amazon, or Spotify, but
right now they're pretty basic.
