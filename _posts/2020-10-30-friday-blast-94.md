[Why write ADRs (2020)](https://github.blog/2020-08-13-why-write-adrs/) - architecture decision records (ADRs) are a
form of technical documentation. They cover the big technical decision made on a project, in a sort of syntehsized
fashion. Much like a design doc, but without going into the nitty-gritty.

[Type in the exact number of machines to proceed (2020)](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/10/26/num/) - a nifty
double-check for potentially destructive commands of all kinds. Don't just _do it_ or require a simple _Yes/No_ answer.
Rather ask the person to work a bit for the answer and also tie it to the magnitude of the mutation - ie number of
machines affected by the change.

[Achieving maintainability with hexagonal architecture (2019) #video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKbVrsMnhDc&feature=youtu.be) -
another short intro to hexagonal architecture.

[Homesteading the Twittersphere (2020)](https://danco.substack.com/p/homesteading-the-twittersphere) - an interesting
take on why there are so many high-quality _analyst-type_ blogs and newsletters lately (the author included).
Humans value _status_ quite a lot, but in an abundance of information scenario, the old patterns of status via
wealth or via power don't really help in establishing the proper hierarchy. But status via gift does. Much like with
open-source software many years earlier. Put out some complex and useful software for free, benefit from the recognition,
and get extra IRL rewards from this.
