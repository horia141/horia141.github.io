title: 'The Clone Test'

You might have heard of the [“Netflix Keeper Test”](https://jobs.netflix.com/culture). This is a part of their
culture where a manager asks themselves if one of their reports were to leave, would they fight for them. 

And if not, then they part ways with that person with a nice severance and warm handshake. It's a way in which they
ensure they have the right people - enough talent density as they put it.

It’s interesting in the zany way of Netflix. But it also feels callous and unnecessarily harsh.

So how about the opposite … a test to determine if you’d wanna keep someone _no matter what_. I call it
“The Clone Test”. 

You just ask yourself the following - if it was technologically possible and ethically allowed would you _clone_
the person several times in your team or not. And if yes, then you know you have some high performer type person.
