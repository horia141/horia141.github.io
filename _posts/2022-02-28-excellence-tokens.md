title: 'Excellence Tokens'
---
A while ago I came across the concept of 
[innovation tokens](https://www.lessannoyingbusiness.com/post/innovation-tokens). 
It's a neat and powerful idea. In short, you have a limited number of
_times_ you can innovate in any new project or company. Every time you do
something _new_ you spend one token. This can be using new technology or
adopting new processes. Or it can even be how you define benefits in
your company or going all-in on remote working. Of course, there’s no
_real limit_. But innovation has a _cost_ and you should acknowledge it
and make sure you spend it in the right places. Too much innovation can
thus cause a project to fail. It can overextend the capabilities of
the team implementing it. Or make the project hard to understand for
users.

In a similar vein, I’m also coming to the conclusion that there are
_excellence tokens_ for companies. This means that a company can't be good 
at everything. In the best case, it will be great in a couple of areas.
And adequate in most. And bad in a few. Like with innovation tokens,
there is a limit to how many things you can be good at. In the end, it
is a choice by the leadership team where and how to invest. But of
course, other factors play in. The founding team or initial key
employees shape things to a great extent. The particular industry also
demands some tokens be spent as table stakes. Finally, some tokens are
used to steer the company a certain way. That can provide a competitive
advantage in the market. Or it can help with defining a more attractive
employee value proposition.

For example, Google is well known for its engineering, people ops, and
lavish perks. This is an area they have worked on to be great. But their
legal and financial teams are good. Enough to handle the mighty task of
running such a complex business, but no more. And their customer support
is infamously bad. As well as anything involving large groups of people
doing manual work.

On the other hand, Amazon has excellent customer support and can
mobilize armies of millions. But their engineering and product management
is just good enough for their needs. And their people operations is the
stuff of Hacker News rants.

Drawing from my own experience, StackOverflow was great working with
their community. And they were legendary for the
[thriftiness](https://stackexchange.com/performance) of their
infrastructure. Business development was not their forte, and I was
narrowly missed by a layoff while there.

Of course, it goes without saying that some companies don't use up any excellence
tokens. Good enough will take you a long way.

As a candidate evaluating a company for a potential role, it is well
worth it to understand where the company chose to spend its excellence 
tokens. It’s an extension of the discussion in the 
[anti-patterns](https://horia141.com/seven-antipatterns.html) post 
and the [taxonomy post](https://horia141.com/taxonomy-companies.html).
Ideally, everybody in the interview pipeline should be able to answer
this question. And all in the same way. But usually, some sort of EM or
company elder you meet can best clue you in on how things are. To start
the conversation you can ask questions like “_What do you think sets 
this company apart from others?_”. Or “_What gives you an edge vs your
competitors?_”. Or even “_Out of all the activities your company does, 
which ones would you say management gives higher priority to?_”.

The answers won't be clearly good or bad here. Not like the profit 
center vs cost center decision, they do impact your experience at the 
company. Positively if you are aligned and quite negatively if you’re not.
For engineers, in particular, a lot of the “_product managers won’t
allow us to refactor this codebase to $latestTech_" discussions, are in 
fact “the company has not chosen engineering as a point of excellence”.
So purely technical justifications won’t work from the start. 
Nor will ones showing fuzzy increases in developer performance have much
sway. But showing how the proposed improvement can help or enable
something the organization has deemed important might. At least you’re
coming armed with the same sorts of weapons.

Anyway, that’s it for this post. Stay safe everyone through these dark
times!
